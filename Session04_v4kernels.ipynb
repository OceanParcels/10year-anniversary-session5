    "As mentioned in the presentation, the main changes to Kernels in Parcels v4 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Kernels, use actual dates, rather than seconds from start of FieldSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `particle.dt` is now a `np.timedelta64`. Be aware when you do `x = v * dt`!\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 'signature' of the Kernel changes from `Kernel(particle, fieldset, time)` to `Kernel(particles, fieldset)`, so no more `time`. Use `particle.time` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `particle_dlon` etc. has been changed to `particle.dlon`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `particle.delete()` method has been removed. Delete particles by setting their state to `StatusCode.Delete`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kernels now run as separate functions, not as one large concatenated function. This means that variables defined in one Kernel are not available in the next Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No more `if`-statements. Use `np.where` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for python functions in Kernels.\n",
    "\n",
